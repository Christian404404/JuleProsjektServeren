4️⃣ How to use

1. Copy template.controller.js → rename to something like feature.controller.js

2. Copy template.routes.js → rename to feature.routes.js

3. Fill in the logic inside controller functions

4. Mount routes in app.js

This way you never have to rewrite the async + JWT boilerplate — just fill in your custom logic.
